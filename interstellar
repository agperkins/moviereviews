This movie is yet another success in Christopher Nolans ever increasing blockbuster titles.
The combination of emotion and scientific themes based on actual physical phenomenons, expressed in the main
characters decision to leave earth and his family is truly gripping. As he travels through space and, because of the
effects of relativity, time, you see his family grow, and you feel and understand the difficulty of what he has done.
